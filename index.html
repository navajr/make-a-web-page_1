    <div class="topic"><b>What a web page and how does it work?</b></div>
<p><br> A web page is a text document written in language called <b>HTML</b>, (<em> Hypertext Markup Language</em>). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them. This collection of HTML code makeup the WWW also known as the Internet. The Internet is the world largest computer network with a bunch of computers communicating using the main protocol of the web called <em>HTTP</em>. <br>When a person goes to the web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user’s computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user’s screen.<br>

    <b>Elements and Tags</b>
  </div>
  <p>Elements give structure to a HTML document and tells the browser how you want your website to be presented. Generally elements consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
  All tags have the same format: they begin with a less-than sign and end with a greater-than sign >.
  Generally speaking, there are two kinds of tags - opening tags: opening and closing tags. The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash "/". You label content by putting it between an opening tag and a closing tag.<br><a href=”https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444”>This video</a> gives a good overview of HTML tags.</p>
  <div class="topic"><b> HTML Links </b>
    </div>    
<p>Making Links in HTML is easy and a cool way to reference url’s to words in texts
<b>HTML Attributes</b> use a tag ATTR = “ value”> contents tag format.  Using the anchor A with href attribute name and a url for the value links the url to the contents that follow before the closed tag.<br><a href=”https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411”>This video</a> gives a good explanation on how to make links</p>

  <div class="topic"><b> Inline vs. Block Element</b></div>
<p> All<em><b> Whitespace</b></em> is entered in a single line. There is a way to have line breaks by using  (b) void tags. Another way is by using (p) tag  that has contact.  Why do we have a way of making two lines?  The (br) tag is what we call inline  while the (p) tag is what we call block.  The br tag is just ending a line. The p tag makes an invisible box and has length and width associated with it.<br>

<div class="topic"><b> Span vs. Div Elements</b></div>
  <p>Two other elements that are important are <b>span</b> and <b>div</b>. With these two elements you can attach styles to them to adjust different behaviors of how text styles or how it’s displayed. the big difference between the twois  Span is an inline element while div is block element.</p><br>

    <div class="topic">
        <b> The tree-like structure of HTML </b>
      </div>
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them.
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
        nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
        boxes, and so on... Here is an example of a "Tree-like Structure"</p>

        <b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
      </div>
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
        Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
        life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
        generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
        When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
        of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

        <b>What is CSS</b></div>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements</p>
